# PS3 PWM Fan Control

## Problem

Playstation 3 is suffering from overheating due to it being stored in a small, enclosed space. 

 ## Solution
 
Use the pulse width modulation signal(PWM) generated by the Playstation 3 for it's internal fan in conjuntction with an Arduino Mega to control an external fan that circulates air inside the enclosed space, for the ultimate goal of significantly reducing or completely elimnating overheating problems.

## Criteria

My goal is to use a Y splitter cable to split the PWM signal coming from the inside the console. Then using one of the outputs to drive the internal fan, leaving the original Playstation 3 cooling unaffected. The cable carrying the second output will be routed oustide the Playstation and will be read in by the Arduino. From here the Arduino will either pass the original signal onto the external fan unaffected or if requested by the user the signal can be modified, effectively changing the speed of the external fan. This communication will be done over a Arduino Ethernet Shield.

## Procedure

I dissasembled the Playstation 3 to reach internal fan and PWM connector. I started by removing a handful of philips and tamper proof torx screws from the bottom of the console, then flipping the console over and lifting the top cover off to expose its fan and wires, one of which is the PWM, the other two being GND and +12V. The origin of these wires seemed to be coming from under the power supply. I simply unplugged the two connectors circled below and I was then able to remove the power supply.

Once the power supply was removed it was easy to see where the origin of the fan wires came from, simply pulling up on the connector was enough to unplug it. With some research I was able to find out that the Grey wire is the PWM, the Brown is +12V and the Black is GND.
