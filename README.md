# PS3 PWM Fan Control

## Problem

Playstation 3 is suffering from overheating due to it being confined in a small, enclosed space. 

 ## Solution
 
 Use the pulse width modulation signal generated by the Playstation 3 for the internal fan in conjuntction with an Arduino Mega to control an external fan that circulates air inside the enclosed space, for the ultimate goal of significantly reducing or completely elimnating overheating problems.
